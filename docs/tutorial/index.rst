Javascript Sandbox Tutorial
===========================

This is a javascript sandbox tutorial for writing standalone Javascript sandbox applications (that connect to Junebug) too.


What is the sandbox?
--------------------

A sandbox is an isolated execution environment, but its used in production, not testing, and its role is to provide access to carefully selected external resources and capabilities (e.g. logging, web requests, a key-value store, sending messages).


Introduction to an example weâ€™re going to use for this tutorial
---------------------------------------------------------------

In this tutorial we're going to write a sandbox application for `CTA train tracker <http://www.transitchicago.com/traintracker/default.aspx>`_ to shows a list of in-service trains and basic information and the locations for one or more specified `"L" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_%22L%22>`_ routes.

------------------------

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Understand the structure of a sandbox application repository
- Write a sandbox application
- Write tests
- Know how to make an HTTP request from a sandbox application
- Translate your application into other languages
- Work with promises
