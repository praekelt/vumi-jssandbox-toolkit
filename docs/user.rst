User
====

:class:`User` is used for short-term information about a user interacting with
your application. Most of this information relates to the current interaction session with the user, and includes the user's current state, user's answers to previous states and language preference. While :class:`User` is used for short-term information about a user, a :class:`Contact` holds long-term information.
